# TurtleShell

TurtleShell is a decentralized application built on multiple EVM chains including Goerli, Mumbai and Aurora Testnet. It provides Smart Contract Security Audits using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The application consists of a frontend React (Vite) application, a backend NestJS server, a machine learning model and a TurtleShell Smart Contract for issuing on-chain NFT audit badges. These soul-bound NFTs are issued to Smart Contracts that have been audited by TurtleShell.
